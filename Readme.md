## Vehicle Info Camera 
An app made using Firebase MLKit Text Recognizer, JSoup and a little bit of opencv.
Useful for general purpose OCR as well.

## WIP
#### TODO
	[X] Use Firebase OCR
	[X] Add Permission handler
	[X] Add OpenCv morph
	[X] now fix jsoup to download captcha and show in image preview 
	[ ] Find CV parameters on sample from pc
	[ ] getting majorText from the bounding boxes
	[ ] Putting numberplate data into text on preview btn click
	[X] Flash btn from OMR
	[ ] Add Bottom Drawer 

#### Excess

 Textbox style just like numplate

 Test Imgproc preprocess onto cameraSource bytebuffer frames

#### Much Excess

Remove opencv, process only bitmap
